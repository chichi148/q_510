#Some words of caution on force-field files.

The files you will  find here are under revision at the moment, so, a
big word of caution comes with their use.

They  have  not been  revised  thoroughly,  and newer  improvements  to
force-fields, such as the one known as CHARMM36 might be incomplete. 

There might even be empty folders and also missing information.

Also, a reminder  that what we call libraries in  Q is called topology
in other  molecular dynamics programs.  Parameter files keep  the same
name and analog information to that of other programs.

As we  revise the force-field  files we will start  documenting where
the information contained  in them comes from, so,  expect a README.md
specific  for each  folder containing  force-filed files  in the  near
future.
