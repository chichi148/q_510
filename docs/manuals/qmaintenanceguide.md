#Q Maintenance guide

####Update:Mauricio Esguerra May 13, 2014*
######Original by: John Marelius, August 29, 2000*


This document describes how to maintain the Q programs at the Åqvist
group. Recently the code, documentation, and some scripts have been
added to version control using github, these documents still need some
updating.


##File locations

The current source code for Q and documentation has been pushed to a
github private organization located at https://github.com/qusers

##Updating Q

You need to be a member of the owners team at the github repository.

###Updating source code on the web server

NOTE CHANGE THIS TO GIT WAY

~~After  modifying any  of  the master  source  files in  g:\\src\\q4:
Update  the  version number  and  last-modified-date  of  the file  in
question, e.g. md.f90, and in the main program, e.g. qdyn.f90. Run the
script g:\\src\\tarQ4.csh to update the files on the web server.~~

###Updating force field files

NOTE CHANGE THIS TO GIT WAY

~~After  modifying  the  master  files  in  g:\\FF4,  run  the  script
g:\\FF4\\ff2web.csh  to  update the  files  on  the  web server  (both
separated files and compressed archive files).~~

###Updating the manual

NOTE CHANGE THIS TO GIT WAY

~~After making  changes to the manual,  update the PDF  version on the
web server as follows: Log  on to Gem (outside Erling’s office).  Open
the manual  (g:\\doc\\Qman4.doc) Print it  to the print  driver called
‘Acrobat Distiller’. Check  the options to see that  Letter size paper
is used  (so that our US  users can print without  problem).  When the
Adobe Acrobat  window appears, save the  PDF file as  Qman4.pdf in the
wwwroot\\Q directory on the web server.~~



##Building executables

This sections describes how to compile the code using the makefile to
select which pakages to compile and which compiler.
In short, a new makefile updated to use te GNU fortran compilers, and
the intel fortran compiler has been created.

In general the use of the makefile is as follows:
```bash
make
```

The make alone command will show you the options which have to be specified at
compilation depending on the compiler available in your machine and the set of
programs you want to compile, for example, the [all] option stands for compilation
of programs except for the parallel version of qdyn5.

To compile  using the  Intel fortran compiler,  and a  debuggable (via
gdb) version of  the code you would give the  following options to the
make command:

```bash
make debug COMP=ifort
```

###Windows

Compiling in Windows XP has been tested to work for the serial version of the code, not the parallel one yet.

The successful compilation was done using  MinGW to be able to use the
GCC  (Gnu  Compiler Collection),  therefore  you  will  have to  first
install MinGW, then make sure that  the location of it is in your path
(C:\MinGW\bin) and then  you can compile in the  command prompt in the
same way it's done in unix flavors, that is:

```bat
make all COMP=gcc
```

It  is quite  possible that  the  compilation will  go trough  without
issues with the intel compiler, but this has not been tested yet.

###Linux - Generic(gfortran)
By default if a second  COMP=[compilername] option is not given to the
make  command the  make  program  will use  as  defaults the  gfortran
compiler options:
```bash
make all
```

###Mac OSX (mavericks)
The compilation of  the Q set of programs  using the gfortran compiler
needs a few different options to those used in say, linux, so in order
to compile in the most recent version of the Mac OSX, you need to use:
```bash
make all COMP=osx
```

###Linux - CentOS 6.5 (triolith) Intel

```bash
module load intel/14.0.2
git clone https://github.com/qusers/qsource.git
cd qsource/src
make all COMP=ifort
module load impi/4.1.3.048
make mpi COMP=ifort
```

###Linux - CentOS 6.5 (glenn) AMD Opteron 6220
Since the problem with finding the correct path to linker libraries keeps
being an issue an alternative solution is to compile using the intel
fortran compiler and mpi libraries. Even though the processors are not
Intel in this cluster, the intel compiler and libraries have been shown
in many benchmarks to be even the optimal choice for non-Intel CPU's.
Benchmarking results comparing compilations with intel/impi against gcc/ompi
here would be appreciated.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qusers/qsource.git
cd qsource/src
module load intel-mkl/11.2
make all COMP=ifort
module load intel-mpi/4.1.1.036
make mpi COMP=ifort
```

As stated before there is some issue with finding the path to linker libraries, so, I've used
the compilation flags used in the mac in this case.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qusers/qsource.git
cd qsource/src
module load  gcc/4.8/4.8.1
make all COMP=osx
module load openmpi/1.5.4
make mpi COMP=gcc
```                   


###Linux - CentOS 6.3 (csb) Intel

To compile at csb follow these steps:
```bash
source /home/apps/intel/composer_xe_2013.5.192/bin/ifortvars.sh intel64
export OMPI_FC=ifort
git clone https://github.com/qusers/qsource.git
cd qsource/src
make all COMP=ifort
make mpi COMP=ifort
```

This will create the parallel executable qdyn5p

Once compilations  is succesful you run  the simple test  in the /test
folder with the run_test_mpi.sh script.  You would only have to create
another script  for the slurm  queue where you  make sure to  load the
openmpi libraries with:
```bash
module load openmpi-x86_64
```

###Linux - Ubuntu 12.04 (abisko) AMD
To compile at abisko follow these steps:
```bash
module load openmpi/gcc/1.6.5
git clone https://github.com/qusers/qsource.git
cd qsource/src
make all COMP=gcc

module load openmpi/gcc/1.6.5
make mpi COMP=gcc
```

###Linux - Scientific Linux 6.5 (tintin) AMD

At tintin both gcc and intel fotran compilers are available.
The architecture of the computer nodes is of the AMD family.
Each node has two Opteron 6220 cpu's having 8 nodes each.

To compile at tintin using gcc use these recipe:
```bash

unset SSH_ASKPASS

###USE YOUR USERNAME INSTEAD OF esguerra
git clone https://esguerra@github.com/qusers/qsource.git 

###It will ask for your password and download the full qsource repository 
###containing code and documentation showing something like:
remote: Counting objects: 934, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (449/449), done.
remote: Total 934 (delta 476), reused 934 (delta 476)
Receiving objects: 100% (934/934), 16.79 MiB | 3.59 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (476/476), done.

###If that works for you, hopefully, then go with:
cd qsource/src/
module load gcc/4.8.2
make all COMP=gcc

###And to compile the parallel version
module load openmpi/1.4
make mpi COMP=gcc
```
For compilation using the ifortran compiler:

```bash
module load intel openmpi
make all COMP=ifort
make mpi COMP=ifort
```


##Updating the Q web site

The    Q    website    page    is    now   located    at    the    url
http://xray.bmc.uu.se/~aqwww/q, but  plans are underway  to migrate it
to a new address and keep it under version control.


##The E-mail list

The       home      page      of       the      list       is      at:
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/qmoldyn.     If   you're    in   the
google-group owners team  then you can see the  member list etc.  Just
log in  to your google account,  go to the  group web page and  on the
upper right side  of the page click on Manage. This  will show you all
the users  on the group (which  is configured as a  mailing list), and
also a lot of configuration information for the list.

To send a message to the list, address it to qmoldyn@googlegroups.com
